I design and evaluate trading systems at the infrastructure and risk layer.

My work focuses on execution realism, failure prevention, and long-term system survivability,
not strategy optimization, indicator tuning, or signal generation.

This GitHub is intentionally used as an architectural reference point, not a code showcase.

Pinned repositories document how trading systems fail under real capital,
imperfect execution, and operational stress, and how to design them to survive.
